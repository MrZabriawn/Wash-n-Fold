Laundromat Website prompt

You are Claude Code. Build a production-ready, single-page website for “Aliquippa Wash n Fold” as a static site (no backend required). Use modern, clean HTML/CSS/JS (or React + Vite if you prefer), mobile-first, fast load, accessible (WCAG-minded), and easy to self-host. Deliver a complete repo with clear file structure, comments, and a short README with local run steps.

IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURE CONSTRAINT
- The site must remain static.
- Form submissions must be handled via FormSubmit (email relay).
- No server-side code, databases, or secrets.
- SMS/phone links are allowed as secondary actions, not primary submission handling.
- Implement anti-spam Option 1 (honeypot field) to reduce bot submissions.

Brand / Business
- Business name: Aliquippa Wash n Fold
- Address: 447 Franklin Avenue, Aliquippa, PA 15001
- Primary phone: 724-800-0295
- Tone: practical, neighborhood-friendly, professional
- Include a sticky “Call/Text” button for mobile using tel: and sms: links to 724-800-0295.

PAGE STRUCTURE (single page with anchored sections)

1) Hero / Top Bar
- Simple hero with name and short promise (fast, affordable wash & fold).
- Primary CTA: “Place an Order”
- Secondary CTA: “Call/Text 724-800-0295”
- Hours placeholder and “same-day when available” disclaimer.

2) Wash & Fold Order Section (core feature)
Create a prominent HTML form that submits via FormSubmit.

Form behavior
- Use:
  <form action="https://formsubmit.co/YOUR_EMAIL_HERE" method="POST">
- Include FormSubmit control fields:
  - _subject = “New Wash & Fold Order”
  - _template = “table”
  - _captcha = false (initially)
  - _next = thank-you confirmation page or section
- All pricing logic runs client-side only.
- On submit:
  - FormSubmit emails the full order details.
  - Show a confirmation message on success.

Anti-spam (honeypot field) — REQUIRED
- Add ONE honeypot text input that is visually hidden via CSS (not type="hidden").
- Use a generic field name like "company" or "website" (do not name it "honeypot" or "spam").
- Set autocomplete="off" and tabindex="-1".
- Place it near the top of the form.
- Add a short inline comment explaining what it is.
- If the honeypot receives a value, block submit client-side OR allow submit but include a hidden flag so it’s obvious in the email. Prefer blocking submit with a generic error message.
